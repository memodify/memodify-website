I created a remark plugin [remark-next-mdx-frontmatter](https://github.com/tmtk75/remark-next-mdx-frontmatter)
which allows us to use frontmatter with [@next/mdx](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx#nextmdx)
since @next/mdx doesn't officially support frontmatter.

Please see the README so that you can use frontmatter.
The plugin is used for this blog.

The supported version of MDX is v2.
It's a very simple implementation as inserting a component which is for layout.
