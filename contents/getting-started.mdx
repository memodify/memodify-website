# Getting Started

You can quickly get started with the in-broswer memodify.
Please visit

<a
  href="//memodify.app/"
  target="application"
  className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded text-base hover:drop-shadow-sm hover:bg-gray-200"
>{"https://memodify.app"}</a>

You will see an alert at left-bottom and you can import a sample data set there by clicking a button to import.
The data set has some notes, labels and roles as a manual and samples.

It's easy to start using memodify with private bwowsing/incognito mode because the imported data has gone when you close the window.
