# Remarkable Features

## MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

Memodify supports Chart.js and Mermaid as builtin components. You can embed charts and diagrams easily.

### Caution

<span
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "tomato",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bold",
    padding: "2px 4px",
    borderRadius: "2px",
    fontSize: "90%",
  }}
>Caution</span>
When using MDX feature in Memodify, it is important to only use
content from trusted sources. MDX can potentially execute malicious code, known as
self-XSS, which can compromise your device's security. I recommend only using MDX
with content that you have personally created or obtained from a trusted source.
Use this feature at your own risk, and always be vigilant when inputting or importing
content into the MDX editor.

## Palette Interface
### Command palette
You can use command palette with `command + shift + p`.
