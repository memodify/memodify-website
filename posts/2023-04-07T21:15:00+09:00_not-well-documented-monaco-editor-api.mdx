# Summary
[Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) is a powerful web-based code editor
used in a variety of programming environments. Although the editor has extensive documentation,
some of its APIs, such as `addKeybindingRule` and `getContribution`, are not well-documented.
These APIs provide developers with powerful customization options for the editor.

Memodify uses Monaco Editor and the APIs in order to support some features.

# APIs
## addKeybindingRule
[`addKeybindingRule`](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/typedoc/functions/editor.addKeybindingRule.html) is an API used to add custom keybindings to Monaco Editor.
The API takes an object with properties keybinding and handler,
where keybinding is a string representing the desired key combination,
and handler is a function to be called when the key combination is pressed.

Here's an example:

```typescript
monaco.editor.addKeybindingRule({
    keybinding: monaco.KeyMod.CtrlCmd | monaco.KeyCode.KEY_S,
    command: 'my.custom.keybinding',
});
```
In this example, the `command` property is a unique identifier for the keybinding,
and the `keybinding` property uses the monaco.KeyMod and monaco.KeyCode enums to define the desired key combination.

## getContribution
[`getContribution`](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/typedoc/interfaces/editor.ICodeEditor.html#getContribution) is an API used to retrieve a contribution from Monaco Editor.
Contributions are modules that extend the editor's functionality, such as code completion,
syntax highlighting, and linting. The `getContribution` API takes a single parameter,
the ID of the desired contribution, and returns the contribution object. Here's an example:

```typescript
const contrib = monaco.editor.getContribution('my.contribution.id');
...
```
Once retrieved, the contribution can be used in a variety of ways, such as:

* controlling editor functionality programmatically
* creating custom UI elements
* dynamically adding functionality to the editor

any issues that may arise when using these APIs.

In conclusion, the `addKeybindingRule` and `getContribution` APIs in Monaco Editor provide powerful customization options for developers.
`addKeybindingRule` can be used to easily customize keybindings, while `getContribution` can be used
to retrieve and control editor functionality programmatically. Developers can use these APIs to achieve even more
advanced customizations in their Monaco Editor applications.
