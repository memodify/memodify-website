## CouchDB
You can backup your data into CouchDB and restore it from there.

Go to `Settings` -> `Datbase: CouchDB URL`.

Input http://admin:password@localhost:5984/memodify.

```
$ docker run \
    -e COUCHDB_USER=admin \
    -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password \
    -p 5984:5984 \
    -v `pwd`/couchdb:/opt/couchdb/data \
    couchdb:3.3.1
```
```
npx add-cors-to-couchdb http://admin:password@localhost:5984
```

Then you can backup your all documnets for memodify.

Open the command palette with `Shift + command + P`, then select `file:backup`.

### Conflict resolution
Please note memodify doesn't resolve conflicts automatically.
You have to resolve them by yourself. In order to do that,
you can use CouchDB admin console. It's http://localhost:5984/_utils if your CouchDB is running at your own host.
