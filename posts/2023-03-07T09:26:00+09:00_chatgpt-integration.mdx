I have experimentally implemented the ChatGPT function, which is currently trending.
You can send the selected text on the editor to ChatGPT.

Press `F1` to show the editor menu after selection and choose "Experimental:Send to ChatGPT".
The response will be inserted just after the selected text.

At the moment, previous questions cannot be taken over, so you cannot ask consecutive questions.

An OpenAI API key is required.
Please obtain an API key from the following website and set it according to
the instructions [here](/docs/#configyaml), then restart the application.
