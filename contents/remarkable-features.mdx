# Remarkable Features

## MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

Memodify supports Chart.js and Mermaid as builtin components. You can embed charts and diagrams easily.

### Chart.js

TBD

### Mermaid

TBD

### Caution

<Chip style={{ backgroundColor: "tomato" }}>Caution</Chip>
When using MDX feature in Memodify, it is important to only use content from trusted
sources. MDX can potentially execute malicious code, known as self-XSS, which can
compromise your device's security. I recommend only using MDX with content that you
have personally created or obtained from a trusted source. Use this feature at your
own risk, and always be vigilant when inputting or importing content into the MDX
editor.

## Palette Interface

### Command palette

You can use command palette with `command + shift + p`.

### Note palette

You can focus on a note with note palette. It's activated with `command + p`.

<img width="48%" src="/note-palette.png" />

## Per-note encryption

It's supported to encrypt the focused note body.

`crypto:encrypt note body` opens a dialog and you can enter a passphrase.
It converts the body to a JSON object like this.

```
{
  "ciphertext": "dtsLElgKr9p4r5L8xZoiOw==",
  "iv": "5aL3VtMJsSRjrYaJ",
  "salt": "jOV7M/sQcJaxIB3xj+uaYw=="
}
```

`crypto:decrypt note body` decrypt it.

<Chip>Note</Chip> Currenly the preview shows an error like this
because `{...}` is recognized as an MDX expression. I'm going to suppress this in the future.
